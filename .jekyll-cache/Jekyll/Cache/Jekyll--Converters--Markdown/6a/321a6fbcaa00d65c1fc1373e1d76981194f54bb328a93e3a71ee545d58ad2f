I"><p>Today, I recalled a previous interview that I was asked, “What apps do you think have a better user experience and why ” At that time, I didn’t have an answer in my head, so I just made up one. The reason I suddenly remembered this today is that I finally knew why I didn’t have an answer at that time.</p>
