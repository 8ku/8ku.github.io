This is my first time trying 3D printing.

The general concept of and procedure to be used in 3D printing was first described in 1945. [The first commercial 3D printers released in 1987 or 1988. As of 2020, 3D printers have reached the level of quality and price that allows most people to enter the world of 3D printing. When I heard that people around me bought their own printers, I realized that the price of a 3D printer was so low that normal people could buy one.

As someone who has been modeling for many years, I have always had an interest in bringing computer modeling to life. A friend wanted someone to make a Lyre for her BJD doll, so I volunteered to help design and print it.

Modeling on the computer is very different from producing in reality, and I also learned for the first time about the boundary values of 3D printing, how to adjust the size of the model to align with reality, how to clean up the number of model faces, merge unnecessary parts, and so on.

The first printout came out very well ,which gave me a lot of confidence. I can bring more ideas to life with printing.
