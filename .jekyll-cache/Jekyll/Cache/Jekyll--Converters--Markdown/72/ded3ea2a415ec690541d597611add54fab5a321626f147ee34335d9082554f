I"½<p>A set of 3D character designs and scenes.</p>

<p>I learned Blender in a short time in order to become more proficient in modeling in my own game. Since I was a kid, I have been exposed to various modeling software, like 3Ds Max, Rhinoceros 3D, Cinema 4D, ZBrush, etc. It didnâ€™t take long for me to get started with such sortware. After getting familiar with the dazzling shortcuts, I found that Blender is indeed the most user-friendly 3D software I have ever come across.</p>

<p>While practicing Blender, I made a 3D model of an image I had previously designed based on a friend.</p>

  <img data-src="/assets/images/3DArt/3D_Sheep_model.jpg" data-src-2x="" src="" title="" alt="model" />
  </div>

<p>And based on that, I designed some scenes.</p>
