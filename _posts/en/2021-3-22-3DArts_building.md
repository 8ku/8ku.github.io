This is a test of the scene style I did for the first level of my game.

Reference to the architectural style of Florence, Naples and Barcelona.

After it was done, I felt that the classical Italian architecture did not fit the theme of the game, and I couldnâ€™t explain the origin of the architectural style, so I overturned it all and reconstructed it.

The second version used a more concise and unified style.
